# CUNY-Spring-2020

Course material for Interactive Data Visualization (DATA 73200) taught at CUNY Spring Semester, 2020.

This repository contains the starter code for each of the 7 tutorials.

## Setup

1. Make sure the following are installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) - version control software. You will also need an account on [Github.com](https://github.com/).
    - NOTE: If you are using a PC, an application called "git bash" will be part of the default git install. You should use this application every time we reference "terminal", rather than the "command prompt". Mac users, you will be using the default terminal already installed on your machine.
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - javascript development software. You can check if the install was succesful by running `node -v` in your git bash (PC) or terminal (Mac). It should return your version number. 
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - free code editor and IDE (our recommendation)

After each installation, 

2. Use these instructions to [set up](./GIT_SETUP.md) your local git repository.

3. Follow these instructions to run a [basic server](./BASIC_SERVER.md) to serve your files and data to the browser.

4. Start creating awesome visualizations ðŸŽ‰!
